## 📌 Visualizations Included

1. **Bar Chart** – Profit by Category  
   → To show which broad categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) are profitable.

2. **Clustered Bar Chart** – Profit by Sub-Category  
   → Drills down into specific products (e.g., Tables, Phones, Binders) for detailed performance.

3. **Scatter Plot** – Sales vs. Profit by Sub-Category  
   → Visualizes the relationship between sales and profit, helping identify if high sales mean high profit.

4. **Slicers** – Interactivity added using:
   - `Region`
   - `Category`
   - `Segment`

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📈 **Technology** is the most profitable category overall, with strong performance in Phones and Accessories.
- 📉 **Furniture**, especially **Tables**, shows negative profit — a concern despite decent sales.
- 🔁 **High sales do not always mean high profit**, especially in discounted categories.
- 🧭 Slicers allow dynamic filtering of results by region, category, and segment to explore patterns.

## 📤 How to Use the Dashboard

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Use the **slicers** on the dashboard to filter data by Region, Category, or Segment.
3. Read insights from the charts and use the scatter plot to spot unusual patterns.
